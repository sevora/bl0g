## Overview
This is a blog site done as a project for one of our classes. In here, we talk about our interests be it in sports, shows, and philosophy. The website was written as a single-page application from scratch with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) while [Vite](https://vite.dev/) handles the bundling and works along with transpilation. Please check it out, I know it'll be interesting.

## Commands
These commands can be figured out by learning [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- `npm install` - to install all the dependencies for the transpiler setup. 
- `npm run build` - to transpile the source code inside the js directory and save results to assets bundle folder.
- `npm run dev` - to run the development server.
