                        Indie is more than just a genre &mdash; it's an attitude. It's all about pushing boundaries,
                        experimenting with sound, and refusing to be boxed into one style.

        <p class="content">
            <b>Introduction</b><br />
            With the advent of technology comes a way of life that people before us could only have imagined.
            It is through the endless pursuit of knowledge, ambition, and innovation that all of humanity enjoys the
            wealth of possibilities in living. <br />

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/assets/images/wright.jpg" alt="Wright brother's first flight" />
                <div class="label">Wright Brothers' First Flight on December 17, 1903</div>
            </div>

            Back then, people could only daydream of what it's like to fly in the sky until the Wright brothers
            successfully flew their full-size plane, the very first in the planet. <br /> <br />

            In the early 20th century, if a person contracts even a flu they might as well be considered dead. There was
            no cure for diseases such as malaria, smallpox, polio, measles, and more. All of which have a cure today.
            Advancement in medical technology surely improved our life expectancy. <br /> <br />

            Furthermore, the landscape of entertainment vastly changed. Surely, for kids, it was more popular going out
            and playing with every kid around town back then through sports and games derived from one's culture. For
            teenagers and adults, they would likely be reading or writing, crocheting, hunting, camping and the like.
            But nowadays we're cooped up in our homes, scrolling through our newsfeed, having video calls and chats,
            watching movies and playing video games. <br /> <br />

            Although the changes being good or bad is a matter of perspective, there is one aspect that almost operates
            in an ironic manner. It is, as I believe, our ambition. If people before us were mostly busy surviving, and
            now we're thriving, then how is it that our rate of innovation seems to stagnate and converge. It seems that
            if there was one thing novel, then others would simply swarm towards it as if they were moths drawn to a
            flame. It seems we aren't concerned much about innovation rather we care only about money.
            <br /> <br />

            <b>Let me go off into a tangent</b> <br />
            Kentaro Miura's manga titled Berserk is a piece of media that became heavily popular throughout its release
            back in the 90s. It features "Guts", the protagonist, a swordman, who swings an unusual sword that has been
            repeatedly described as being "too rough and too massive" that the sword itself was seemingly nothing more
            but a "raw heap of iron." <br /> <br />

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/assets/images/guts.jpg" alt="Guts of Berserk" />
                <div class="label">Guts from Kentaro Miura's Berserk</div>
            </div>

            In the fictional world of Berserk, there's magic, gods, and monsters. Guts is merely human. He is set on a
            journey of revenge to right what's wrong and the only way to make progress is to put his life on the line.
            Not everything goes his way when fighting monsters beyond human strength. <br /> <br />

            Yet he swings his sword with all his might, no matter how uphill the battle may seem. He may be covered in
            bruises,
            blood, sweat, and tears, yet he will never succumb to hopelessness. His seemingly inhuman strength wasn't
            given
            to him, he earned it on his own. He kept swinging his sword, he kept fighting and training until he reached
            his best. <br /> <br />

            The story also involves a false messiah who deceives mankind setting the world's course to an age of darkness.
            This character has overflowing charisma and serves as an inspiration to those he deceives. By his side, everyone
            feels secure and comfortable without any clear reason. He is the main antagonist of the story, is nearly as powerful as 
            a god, and is what Guts is trying to take down.<br /> <br /> 

            <b>Going back</b><br />
            Connecting the ideas at hand, the rise of technology made life easy to the point that a good fraction of
            people have become comfortable to the point complacency. <br /> <br />

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="/assets/images/dumb.jpg" alt="Facebook Post of a Bad Essay" />
                <div class="label">Viral Honor Student's Essay on Facebook</div>
            </div>

            In the Philippines, the problem of complacency is much more widespread. Take for example OECD's global student
            assessment. The Philippines is among the lowest in math, science, and reading. Out of 81 countries, the Philippines 
            placed 77th.<br /> <br />

            This truth is further exemplified when a post went viral for an <i>"honor's student"</i> essay who couldn't form 
            a single coherent thought on such a simple topic. But, I bet if they did it online, they would submit something really
            good because, let's be real, they'll just use ChatGPT or cheat in some other way. <br /> <br />

            This complacency makes us rely heavily on the tools that become crutches to human potential. We don't dedicate ourselves
            to an ambition and draw resolve. We dream the dream that the masses idolize without having any heart for it. 
            That is why a lot of people are probably lost on what they want to be or to do. <br /> <br />

            As for me, I know who I am and I know what I want. I have dedicated my life in doing my best. If I have to swing 
            my sword, then I'll swing it with all my might. That philosophy resonates with me. Even if Berserk is fiction, the 
            lessons in it will be as real for as long as I breathe. <br /> <br />
