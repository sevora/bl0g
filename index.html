        <h2 class="byline">by Ralph Louis Gopez</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <b>Introduction</b><br />
            With the advent of technology comes a way of life that people before us could only have imagined.
            It is through the endless pursuit of knowledge, ambition, and innovation that all of humanity enjoys the
            wealth of possibilities in living. <br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/wright.jpg" alt="Wright brother's first flight" />
            <div class="label">Wright Brothers' First Flight on December 17, 1903</div>
        </div>

        Back then, people could only daydream of what it's like to fly in the sky until the Wright brothers
        successfully flew their full-size plane, the very first in the planet. <br /> <br />

        In the early 20th century, if a person contracts even a flu they might as well be considered dead. There was
        no cure for diseases such as malaria, smallpox, polio, measles, and more. All of which have a cure today. <br />
        <br />

        Humanity's ambition and resolve powered us through disasters and tragedies, and with it society improved through
        the
        countless inventions and innovations we take for granted today. What's ironic is, now that we can pretty much
        do anything, we do less and less. <br /> <br />

        <b>Let me go off into a tangent</b> <br />
        Kentaro Miura's manga titled Berserk is a piece of media that became heavily popular throughout its release
        back in the 90s. It features "Guts", the protagonist, a swordsman, who swings an unusual sword that has been
        repeatedly described as being "too rough and too massive" that the sword itself was seemingly nothing more
        but a "raw heap of iron." <br /> <br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/guts.jpg" alt="Guts of Berserk" />
            <div class="label">Guts from Kentaro Miura's Berserk</div>
        </div>

        In the fictional world of Berserk, there's magic, gods, and monsters. Guts is merely human. He is set on a
        journey of revenge to right what's wrong and the only way to make progress is to put his life on the line.
        Not everything goes his way when fighting monsters beyond human strength. <br /> <br />

        Yet he swings his sword with all his might, no matter how uphill the battle may seem. He may be covered in
        bruises, blood, sweat, and tears, yet he will never succumb to hopelessness. His seemingly inhuman strength
        wasn't given to him, he earned it on his own. He kept swinging his sword, he kept fighting and training
        single-mindedly until he was the best. <br /> <br />

        <b>Going back</b><br />
        What I want to express is that there is beauty in a way a mere human polishing their skills to its very limits
        much more enticing than anything in the world. The value of a dream and an ambition weighs much more than
        eternal pleasure or comfort. <br /> <br />

        I want to point out that in our world today, we have become lazier. Unfortunately, this is seemingly the
        trajectory of society. <br /> <br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/dumb.jpg" alt="Viral Facebook Post of an Honor Student's Submission" />
            <div class="label">Viral Facebook Post of an Honor Student's Submission</div>
        </div>

        There is a sign of this problem when a post went viral for an <i>honor's student</i> essay who couldn't form
        a single coherent thought on a simple topic. I bet if they did it online, they would submit something
        really good because, let's be real, they'll just cheat in some way or form. <br /> <br />

        Our laziness makes us rely heavily on the tools that become crutches to human potential. We don't dedicate
        ourselves to an ambition and draw resolve. We dream the dream that the masses idolize without having any heart
        for it.
        That is why a lot of people are lost on what they want to really do. <br /> <br />

        With all that said, I can't really change the world. But what I realized is that I can always act upon myself.
        Berserk's philosophy of <i>swinging a sword with all your might</i> resonates deeply with me and I'll live that
        way regardless
        of how others live. In a way, I still hope that somehow, someway the entirety of humanity changes for the better
        and finds their
        ambition roaring through. If that won't ever happen, it's fine because I lived with all my might. <br /> <br />

        Full swing ahead. <br /> <br />

        <b>What is Indie Music?</b><br />
        Indie music began as a label for tunes crafted by independent artists and small labels, driven by a
        do-it-yourself mindset and a deep love for creative freedom. But indie is more than just a genre—it's an
        attitude. It's all about pushing boundaries, experimenting with sound, and refusing to be boxed into one style.
        Indie musicians draw from a rich mix of influences, blending different genres to create fresh, unexpected tracks
        that stand out from the crowd. By staying true to their roots and remaining independent, hence called indie,
        these artists embrace the freedom to explore and innovate, delivering music that's anything but
        ordinary.<br /><br />

        <b>Birth of Indie</b><br />
        The late 20th century was a period of significant technological advancements and cultural shifts in the music
        industry. It was a period where roller skates, vibrant make-ups, oversized sunglasses, big hoop earrings, and
        flashy clothes quote on quote “were the jazz”. The rise of various genres, such as rock, disco, punk, and
        hip-hop, shaped the landscape. The primary formats for music consumption were vinyl records, cassettes, and CDs,
        with MTV's early 1980s introduction revolutionizing music marketing.<br /><br />

        </div>

        Major record labels held significant power, but independent labels and the DIY music scene emerged, challenging
        their dominance. The digital revolution began with the introduction of first digital recording techniques and
        the internet, setting the stage for major transformations in the 21st century music industry.<br /><br />

        <b>Who were the influential artists?</b><br />
        You may be familiar with the lyrics, 'And if a double-decker bus crashes into us, To die by your side is such a
        heavenly way to die.' These lines are from The Smiths' song 'There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,' which is
        currently making a comeback with Gen Z. While the lyrics might seem a bit intense or dramatic, they vividly
        capture the band's distinctive style. The Smiths marked the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of
        the guitar rock that reigned English rock into the '90s along with the bands Oasis, R.EM, and my personal
        favorites Nirvana, Radiohead, and the Pixies.<br /><br />

        You may have noticed that indie music is gradually diversifying, incorporating a wide range of styles and
        influences. This progression reflects an increasing desire for musical variety and experimentation among new
        generations of musicians, who draw influence from previous trends while carving their own distinct
        pathways.<br /><br />

        <b>Why do we love it?</b><br />
        As others may tell you, Indie music gives us the sensation of nostalgia when listening to it. Indie music does
        not limit the notes, and the rhythm of the song, it allows artists to go wild and end up in creating a fresh new
        beat spanning a diverse set of musical styles and sensibilities.<br /><br />

        Over time, the term “indie” has come to encompass a wide range of genres and styles, including indie-folk, indie
        rock, synth-pop, dream pop, indie rap, and indie R&B, among others becoming modern indie.<br /><br />

        <b>Notable indie albums in the late 20th Century</b><br />

            The Avengers franchise is a must-experience in cinematic history. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has
            crafted a unique superhero narrative that captivates audiences worldwide. Its success is attributed to
            compelling characters, intricate plotlines, and emotional roller-coaster scenes. <br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/avengers.jpeg" alt="The Avengers (2012)" />
            <div class="label">The Avengers (2012)</div>
        </div>

        A key strength of the Avengers series is its ability to unite a diverse group of superheroes into a cohesive
        narrative. This was a significant challenge, but the franchise succeeded by introducing major characters
        with their own backstories and standalone films, along with post-credits scenes (like “I am Iron Man”) that
        hinted at future developments while maintaining an element of surprise. <br /><br />

        "The Avengers" (2012), the first entry in the franchise, assembled established characters like Iron Man,
        Captain America, Thor, and Hulk, while also introducing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. This allowed
        the film to dive straight into action, bypassing extensive origin stories and connecting directly with fans.
        For instance, Iron Man's Tony Stark, Captain America's Steve Rogers, and Thor, who had already been
        well-established in their standalone films, made it easier for audiences to engage with them as an ensemble.
        <br /><br />

        In "The Avengers," the conflict arises when Loki, Thor's adoptive brother, seeks to conquer Earth with an
        alien army. The film's charm lies in the characters' initial clashes and conflicts, highlighting their
        differing personalities and approaches. For example, in the first encounter between Thor, Steve Rogers, and
        Tony Stark, the Big Three show no immediate chemistry. Tony and Thor even fight intensely before Steve
        arrives. This clash, including Thor's frustration when Steve asks him to put his hammer down, makes their
        eventual teamwork and Loki's defeat all the more satisfying. <br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/ultron.jpeg" alt="Ultron and Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron" />
            <div class="label">Ultron and Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron</div>
        </div>

        Following "The Avengers," the franchise continued with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015), which introduced a
        darker tone and a more complex narrative. This sequel explores the consequences of the Avengers' actions and
        adds new characters like Wanda and Pietro Maximoff and Vision (formerly Tony's J.A.R.V.I.S). Internal
        conflicts, particularly the ideological clash between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, lead to a split among the
        team. The introduction of Ultron, an AI created by Stark that goes rogue, contrasts sharply with Vision.
        Despite being weaker than its predecessor, the film features significant moments, such as Thor's hammer
        Mjolnir being moved by Steve Rogers and the iconic Hulk versus Hulkbuster battle. <br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/thanos.jpeg" alt="Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War" />
            <div class="label">Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War</div>
        </div>

        The franchise reaches its peak with "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018), which introduces Thanos, the mad titan
        who believes that wiping out half of the universe's population will ultimately save it. The film's emotional
        impact is profound, with heroes facing unprecedented challenges. The addition of characters like the
        Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Black Panther, and their various combinations,
        creates a dynamic and engaging spectacle. <br /><br />

        "Avengers: Endgame" (2019) serves as a powerful conclusion to the Big Three (Thor, Steve Rogers, and Tony
        Stark) and the original Avengers (Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk), focusing on the aftermath of Thanos'
        devastating snap and the Avengers' efforts to reverse it. Using time travel to revisit key moments from
        previous MCU films evokes nostalgia and perfectly illustrates the five stages of grief. The climactic
        battle, where the Avengers confront Thanos one final time to "Kill him properly this time", delivers an epic
        spectacle while honoring each character's journey. The excitement in theaters was palpable, especially when
        Captain America wielded Thor's hammer—a moment that left audiences in awe (sorry for the spoiler), and of
        course the ending that made us sad and happy at the same time. <br /><br />

        The Avengers franchise is celebrated for its well-developed characters, intricate storylines, and emotional
        depth. Its success lies in blending humor with high stakes, delivering compelling action sequences, and
        creating memorable moments of heroism and sacrifice. Every character resonates with fans not because of
        their perfection but because of their flaws, making them relatable despite their superpowers. As the
        franchise evolves, the new Avengers will carry the torch, continuing to inspire with lessons about courage,
        kindness, and sacrifice. These values should remain in our minds as we navigate life, striving to be a hero
        to someone. <br /><br />

        Man, I can do this all day! <br /><br />

        Basketball is more than just a sport in the Philippines; it is a way of life shared by Filipinos of all
        ages. Whether in busling cities or rural areas, the sound of a bouncing basketball is never far away. The
        presence of basketball courts in nearly every barangay reflects the sport's popularity in the country, with
        over 24,000 public courts and countless private courts spread across over 40,000 barangays, making the game
        accessible to everyone. This popularity has allowed basketball to become more than just a sport; it has
        ingrained itself into Filipinos' daily lives, fostering social interaction, camaraderie, and a shared love
        for the game. Whether it's a casual pick-up game or a local league, basketball holds a special place in
        Filipino culture.<br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/dwightramos.jpg" alt="Dwight Ramos" />
            <div class="label">Dwight Ramos playing for Toyama Grouses</div>
        </div>

        This widespread presence has solidified basketball's status as one of the most popular sports in the
        Philippines. Its dominance is due largely to the sport's accessibility—minimal equipment and low cost for
        participation make basketball an easy choice for many Filipinos. Its role in fostering community spirit
        contributes significantly to its popularity, with local games and tournaments becoming major social events.
        Influential figures such as PBA stars June Mar Fajardo and Terrence Romeo, Filipino players excelling in
        international leagues like Dwight Ramos and Kai Sotto, and rising young stars Kevin Quiambao and Andy Gemao
        have also significantly contributed to basketball's prominence, drawing massive audiences and instilling
        national pride.<br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">

            <div class="label">A thumbnail of Coach Mavrick Bautista's video</div>
        </div>

        Adding to the sport's cultural richness is the "dayo" tradition, where players travel to other barangays or
        cities to compete against local teams. This practice elevates basketball beyond a mere hobby, turning it
        into a platform for showcasing skills and earning community respect. A well-known example of "dayo" can be
        seen in the "dayo series" by YouTuber, Mavrick Bautista, where heated matchups between visiting teams and
        local players often draw large and enthusiastic crowds, creating an electrifying atmosphere. These games are
        typically accompanied by bets, with stakes sometimes reaching thousands of pesos, adding an extra layer of
        intensity. The thrill of "dayo" games comes not just from the action on the court but from the shared
        experience it cultivates—players and spectators alike engage in a unique form of social bonding. The "dayo"
        culture enhances the sport's enjoyment and significance by fostering camaraderie and developing bonds within
        and between barangays.<br /><br />

        Overall, basketball has evolved from a mere sport to become a central element of Filipino entertainment and
        community life. It is more than simply a game; it serves as a social gathering that draws people together,
        whether through small barangay leagues or the exhilarating "dayo" matches. Basketball games act as focal
        points for community bonding, bringing players and fans together through shared excitement and friendly
        rivalry. Its dual role as both a form of entertainment and a community activity makes basketball a unique
        and treasured aspect of Filipino culture. Its ability to unite people, create lasting memories, and build a
        sense of community illustrates why basketball holds such a special place in the hearts of Filipinos.<br /><br />

                    Hunter World</a></div>
        </div>
        As a kid, I grew up with a PlayStation Portable, and one of the games I played was Monster Hunter Freedom
        Unite. It's the second generation of the series and was released in 2008. I quickly became addicted to it
        because of how fun it is, even though the gameplay loop is essentially just hunting monsters, crafting gear,
        and repeating the cycle. It may sound simple at first, but the game is actually quite deep. Monster Hunter
        Freedom Unite features 11 weapons, each with unique playstyles, tons of armor, and a total of 106 monsters
        to hunt. That alone is impressive for a game from 2008, especially one running on the PSP. With such a
        wealth of content, it's easy to lose track of time while playing.<br /> <br />

        As the years went by, I decided to revisit the series by playing Monster Hunter Portable 3rd on the
        PlayStation Portable. Compared to its predecessor, it has a smaller roster of monsters, with only 60.
        However, it compensates with one additional weapon, new weapon movesets, improved graphics, and
        quality-of-life changes that make grinding the game easier. Even though the game is on a smaller scale, it
        was still incredibly fun to play. The memories of playing this game with friends are ones I won't forget for
        a long time.<br /><br />

        In 2018, one of the biggest games in the franchise was released: Monster Hunter World. This game marked a
        turning point for the series, transitioning from the Old World (older generations) to the New World (current
        generation). Before this game, the series was popular mainly in Japan, but it is now known worldwide, having
        sold 20.5 million copies. So why is this game so popular? First, the graphics have improved drastically.
        Compared to its predecessors, the difference is night and day. The developers took a more cinematic approach
        to the series, and it shows. For example, the environments feel alive with bustling locales and monsters
        interacting with each other and their surroundings. These interactions can lead to unexpected events, like
        two monsters fighting each other, adding to the game's cinematic and exciting nature. The weapon count has
        also increased to 14, offering new options for players. Each weapon comes with an improved tutorial to help
        you master it more quickly. The monster designs are unique and intimidating, from Anjanath spewing flames to
        Nergigante using its spikes as weapons. Each design is functional, reflecting the monster's behavior and
        combat style. The game is also very accessible, having been released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and
        Windows. Overall, Monster Hunter World has taken the world by storm with its blend of deep mechanics,
        beautiful design, and a thriving community, cementing its place as one of the best games in the
        series.<br /><br />

        As anticipation builds for the release of 6th generation, starting off with Monster Hunter Wilds. Fans like
        me are excited for next year's release as this next game promises to push the boundaries of the franchise
        even further, improving on the success of the previous titles while introducing new mechanics. Monster
        Hunter Wilds will offer us a new adventure that will captivate both veterans and new hunters alike. As we
        wait for its launch, this game has the potential to give us the best the series has ever achieved and will
        most likely entice the next generation of hunters.<br />

        <h1 class="title">Why Gojo Satoru is the GOAT</h1>
        <h2 class="byline">by Patrick Lawrence Cardeno</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <b>Intro</b> <br />
            "Throughout heaven and Earth, I alone am the honored one." This iconic line from Gojo Satoru in
            Jujutsu Kaisen perfectly encapsulates his belief in his unmatched strength. Let's explore why it's true.
            <br /> <br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/gojohonored.jpg" alt="Gojo Satoru from Jujutsu Kaisen Honored One" />
            <div class="label">Gojo Satoru when he proclaims he is the honored one</div>
        </div>

        <b>Character Intro</b><br />
        Jujutsu Kaisen is a manga and anime series that follows jujutsu sorcerers battling
        curses—malevolent entities born from human negativity. Gojo Satoru, a central character, is renowned for his
        immense power and charismatic personality. As one of the strongest sorcerers, he mentors the protagonist,
        Yuji Itadori, and plays a crucial role in the series' conflicts, contributing to its popularity and
        depth.<br /><br />

        <b>GOAT Meaning</b><br />
        "G.O.A.T." stands for "Greatest of All Time" and refers to someone who surpasses all others in
        skill, achievement, or influence. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo is often considered the G.O.A.T. due to his
        unmatched jujutsu abilities, strategic intelligence, and boastful yet charming personality. His Limitless
        Cursed Technique allows him to manipulate space, making him a nearly unstoppable force. Coupled with his
        sharp intellect and charisma, Gojo embodies the title of the "Greatest of All Time" in the world of jujutsu
        sorcery.<br /><br />

        <b>Gojo's Power and Abilities</b><br />
        In the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, curses are born from human malice, and sorcerers
        exorcise them. Gojo is the strongest among them, known for his power and personality. As one of the four
        special grades, Gojo's inherited technique, Limitless, allows him to control and distort space. This
        technique reaches its full potential thanks to the Six Eyes—a rare physical trait passed down in the Gojo
        family, granting him extraordinary perception and control over cursed energy.<br /><br />

        <b>Gojo's Personality and Philosophy on Strength</b><br />
        Gojo's personality is a key reason for his popularity. He is
        strong, funny, easygoing, and often arrogant, making him both entertaining and memorable. His carefree
        nature allows him to stay relaxed in serious situations, yet he genuinely cares for his students and takes
        his role as a mentor seriously. Gojo's ability to balance his playful side with his sense of responsibility
        adds depth to his character, making him not only powerful but also likable and relatable.<br /><br />

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/gojobirth.jpg" alt="Gojo Satoru when he was born" />
            <div class="label">Gojo Satoru when he was born</div>
        </div>

        <h4>Gojo's Feats</h4>
        <b>Changing the world at birth</b><br /> 
        Gojo was destined to be the strongest from birth, inheriting both the
        Limitless Technique and the Six Eyes—a combination not seen in 400 years. His birth alone altered the balance of the
        world, making the curses after his birth be stronger. Criminals using jujutsu feared him, and even as a
        child, he had a bounty on his head, though no one dared to claim it. Gojo's existence has reshaped the world
        for both better and worse.<br /><br />
        <b>Mastery of Limitless Technique</b><br /> 
        With the help of the Six Eyes, Gojo mastered the Limitless Technique at
        an early age, gaining access to abilities like Infinity (an infinite barrier that stops anything from reaching
        him), Lapse Blue (which draws things in), Reversal Red (which repels things), and Hollow Purple (a
        destructive combination of both). His Domain Expansion, Unlimited Void, traps opponents in a space that
        overwhelms their brains with information, rendering them helpless.<br /><br />

        <b>"Are you the strongest because you're Satoru Gojo? Or are you Satoru Gojo because you're the strongest?"</b>
        This question reflects the deep connection between Gojo's abilities and personality. Is his strength a
        result of his nature, or has his nature been shaped by his strength? Gojo's power and persona are
        intertwined, with each reinforcing the other, making him a character whose greatness stems from both his
        exceptional abilities and his unique demeanor. So neither.<br /><br />

        <b>Conclusion</b><br />
        Gojo Satoru's status as the GOAT in Jujutsu Kaisen is a testament to his unparalleled abilities,
        captivating personality, and profound impact on both the series and its fans. His mastery of the Limitless
        Technique and Six Eyes, combined with his strategic prowess and philosophical outlook on strength,
        solidifies his place as the ultimate GOAT of the jujutsu world.<br /><br />

        <h1 class="title">Lebron James: King of NBA</h1>
        <h2 class="byline">by Ric Pangan</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <b>Intro</b><br />
            LeBron James, often regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has built a career that
            has left an indelible mark on the NBA. From his much-anticipated debut in 2003 to his continued dominance as
            a veteran, James has consistently demonstrated unmatched skill, earning numerous accolades and setting
            records that will endure for years. His journey through the league has been defined by a relentless pursuit
            of greatness, both on and off the court.<br /><br />

            </div>
          
            <b>Early Years and Immediate Impact</b><br />
            Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, LeBron James showed early signs of a rare combination of
            athleticism and basketball IQ. By the time he was in high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary, he had become a
            national sensation, often appearing on magazine covers and being heralded as the future of basketball. His
            high school games were even nationally televised, a rarity that underscored the anticipation surrounding his
            entry into the NBA.<br /><br />

            </div>

            In the 2003 NBA Draft, LeBron was selected as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers, marking the
            start of a new era for the franchise and the league. At just 18 years old, LeBron faced immense expectations
            but quickly proved his worth. In his rookie season, he averaged 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists
            per game, showcasing his versatility and ability to impact the game in multiple ways. His debut performance
            of 25 points, 6 rebounds, and 9 assists against the Sacramento Kings hinted at the greatness to come.
            LeBron's impressive rookie campaign earned him the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, making him the first
            Cavaliers player to receive this honor. Beyond his statistics, what stood out was his poise and maturity on
            the court. Unlike most rookies, LeBron played with the confidence of a seasoned veteran, leading his team
            with an innate understanding of the game. His ability to play and defend multiple positions, combined with
            his court vision and passing ability, made him a unique talent from the start.<br /><br />
            
            <b>Dominance in Cleveland</b><br />
            LeBron's first stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers lasted seven seasons, during which he evolved into one of
            the league's most dominant players. His rapid growth transformed the struggling Cavaliers into a perennial
            playoff contender. In the 2006-07 season, LeBron led the Cavaliers to their first-ever NBA Finals appearance
            at just 22 years old. Though the team lost to the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron's ability to carry a team to the
            Finals at such a young age was a testament to his extraordinary talent and leadership.
            Despite his individual success, including multiple All-Star selections and MVP awards, a championship eluded
            LeBron during his first tenure with Cleveland. Frustrated by the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong
            supporting cast, LeBron made the controversial decision to leave Cleveland in search of a championship
            elsewhere.<br /><br />

            </div>

            <b>The Miami Heat Era</b><br />
            In 2010, LeBron joined the Miami Heat, forming a superteam with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. This move,
            though polarizing, was driven by LeBron's desire to win championships. In Miami, LeBron's career reached new
            heights. He led the Heat to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances, winning back-to-back championships in
            2012 and 2013. His dominance during these years earned him two Finals MVP awards and further cemented his
            legacy as one of the greatest players of all time.<br /><br />

            </div>

            <b>Return to Cleveland and Delivering on a Promise</b><br />
            In 2014, LeBron made a surprising return to Cleveland, driven by a desire to bring a championship to his
            hometown. His return was marked by a deep sense of loyalty and unfinished business. In the 2015-16 NBA
            season, LeBron delivered on his promise, leading the Cavaliers to an epic NBA Finals victory over the Golden
            State Warriors, who had set the record for the most wins in a regular season. LeBron's performance in the
            Finals was legendary, earning him his third Finals MVP award and ending Cleveland's 52-year championship
            drought.<br /><br />

            </div>

            <b>Continuing Excellence with the Los Angeles Lakers</b><br />
            In 2018, LeBron joined the Los Angeles Lakers, a move many saw as the final chapter of his career. Despite
            facing challenges in his first season due to injuries, LeBron returned in 2019-20 with renewed vigor. <br />

            <div class="image-container">

            </div>  

            He led the Lakers to their 17th NBA Championship, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the most in league
            history. LeBron's fourth Finals MVP award made him the first player in NBA history to win the honor with
            three different franchises. Even in his late 30s, LeBron has continued to perform at an elite level,
            solidifying his place among the greatest players in NBA history.

          <div class="content">
            You might be wondering how this website was made. Or maybe, how is it possible 
            that whenever I click any post, it instantly loads it up into the screen almost instantaneously.
            <br /><br />

            How about the fun effects we've put to hook you into a new experience? It's kind of an experiment 
            and it's non-standard for sure. But it's there to give some form of engagement.
            <br /><br />

            Well, the secret is simple. It's pure foundational mastery of web development. There's no frameworks or libraries in place,
            everything was written by hand. This is how you achieve super-efficiency.
            <br /><br />

            This is a single-page application which is a technical term referring to a set of sites that have a certain functionality. If we're being more technical,
            frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular allow a person to create an SPA. <br /><br />
            
            The only difference is that this website is written in vanilla JavaScript.
            Our insanely smart leader, Ralph, wrote a script in order to provide the functionalities that a single-page application framework would 
            more-or-less provide. The focus is on rendering content and pages quick.
            <br /><br />

            <div class="byline">Ralph speaking</div>
            I've identified points on why my methodology on the creation of this website would work very well.
            <ul>
                <li>There is a fixed-size amount of content and I know that the amount is small relative to most sites.</li>
                <li>Frameworks and library introduce overhead in two ways; first in the network, next in the execution of the script.</li>
                <li>Our effects would be most performant if it can be written as precisely as possible.</li>
            </ul>
